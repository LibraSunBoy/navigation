## Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
#name: Deploy static content to Pagesname
#on:
#  #针对默认分支推送运行# Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
#  push:
#    branches: [ "main" ]
#
## Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
#permissions:
#  contents: read
#  pages: write
#  id-token: write
#
## Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
## However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
#concurrency:
#  group: "pages"
#  cancel-in-progress: false
#
#jobs:
#  #单部署作业，因为我们只是在部署# Single deploy job since we're just deploying
#  deploy:
#    environment:
#      name: github-pages
#      url: $Url:${{steps.deployment.output.page_url}}{{steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
#    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
